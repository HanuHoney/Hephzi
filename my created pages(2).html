		<h2>Son of the God + Awaited Messiah</h2>
		<p>Jesus also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a first-century Jewish preacher and religious leader.He is the central figure of <b>Christianity</b>, <q>the world's largest religion</q>. Most Christians believe he is the incarnation of <b>God the Son</b> and <b>the awaited messiah</b> (the Christ), prophesied in the Old Testament.</p>
		<p>Nearly all historical scholars accept <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus">Jesus's historical existence</a> as a real person. Scholars have reached a limited consensus on the basics of Jesus life.</p>

	Jesus was Jewish, born to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary,_mother_of_Jesus">Mary</a>, wife of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Joseph">Joseph</a>. The Gospels of Matthew and Luke offer two accounts of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogy_of_Jesus">genealogy</a>.

Luke traces Jesus' ancestry through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam">Adam</a> to God. The lists are identical between Abraham and David, but differ radically from that point. Matthew has 27 generations from David to Joseph, whereas Luke has 42, with almost no overlap between the names on the two lists. Various theories have been put forward to explain why the two genealogies are so different.

		<p>Jesus is called a craftsman in <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Mark#6:3">Mark 6:3</a>, traditionally understood as carpenter but it could cover makers of objects in various materials, including builders. The Gospels indicate that Jesus could read, paraphrase, and debate scripture, but this does not necessarily mean that he received formal scribal training.</p>
		<p>When Jesus is presented as a baby in the temple per Jewish Law, a man named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeon_(Gospel_of_Luke)">Simeon</a> says to Mary and Joseph that Jesus "shall stand as a sign of contradiction, while a sword will pierce your own soul.

		<h3> Public ministry</h3>
		<img src="file:///C:/Users/SANDYA/Downloads/Jesus%20public%20ministry.jpeg" alt="">
		<p>Scholars divide the ministry of Jesus into several stages. The Galilean ministry begins when Jesus returns to Galilee from the Judaean Desert after rebuffing the temptation of Satan. Jesus preaches around Galilee, and in <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Matthew#4:18">Matthew 4:18–20</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_of_the_disciples">his first disciples</a>, who will eventually form the core of the early Church, encounter him and begin to travel with him. This period includes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sermon_on_the_Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a>, one of Jesus' major discourses, as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calming_the_storm">calming of the storm</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_the_multitude">feeding of the 5,000</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_walking_on_water">walking on water</a> and a number of other miracles and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parables_of_Jesus">parables</a>.

		<h3>Disciples and followers</h3>
		<img src="file:///C:/Users/SANDYA/Downloads/Jesus%20disciples.jpg" alt="">
		<p>&bigstar;Near the beginning of his ministry, Jesus appoints <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioning_of_the_Twelve_Apostles">twelve apostles</a>. In Matthew and Mark, despite Jesus only briefly requesting that they join him, Jesus' first four apostles, who were fishermen, are described as immediately consenting, and abandoning their nets and boats to do so. In John, Jesus' first two apostles were disciples of John the Baptist. The Baptist sees Jesus and calls him the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_of_God">Lamb of God</a>; the two hear this and follow Jesus. In addition to the Twelve Apostles, the opening of the passage of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sermon_on_the_Plain">Sermon on the Plain </a>identifies a much larger group of people as disciples. Also, in <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/Luke#10:1">Luke 10:1–16</a> Jesus sends <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventy_disciples">70 or 72 of his followers</a> in pairs to prepare towns for his prospective visit. They are instructed to accept hospitality, heal the sick and spread the word that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingship_and_kingdom_of_God">Kingdom of God is coming</a>.</p></section>

     	<h3>Teachings and miracles</h3>
     	<img src="file:///C:/Users/SANDYA/Downloads/Jesus%20miracles.jpg" width="320" height="370" alt="">
     	<p>&bigstar;Jesus teaches extensively, often in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable">parables</a>, about the Kingdom of God. John the Baptist, for example, states in <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/John#3:34">John 3:34</a>: "He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure." In <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/John#7:16">John 7:16</a> Jesus says, "My teaching is not mine but his who sent me." He asserts the same thing in <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(American_Standard)/John#14:10">John 14:10</a>: "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works.Approximately 30 parables form about one third of Jesus' recorded teachings. The parables appear within longer sermons and at other places in the narrative. They often contain symbolism, and usually relate the physical world to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality">spiritual</a>. Common themes in these tales include the kindness and generosity of God and the perils of transgression. Some of his parables, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Prodigal_Son">the Prodigal Son</a>, are relatively simple, while others, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Growing_Seed">Growing Seed</a>, are sophisticated, profound and abstruse.</p>
     	<p>&bigstar;In the gospel accounts, Jesus devotes a large portion of his ministry performing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle">miracles</a>, especially healings. The miracles can be classified into two main categories: healing miracles and nature miracles. The healing miracles include cures for physical ailments, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism">exorcisms</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_resurrection">resurrections of the dead</a>. The nature miracles show Jesus' power over nature, and include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_at_Cana">turning water into wine</a>, walking on water, and calming a storm, among others. Jesus states that his miracles are from a divine source.</p>

      reflecting the tale of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Messiah%27s_Donkey">the Messiah's Donkey</a>, an oracle from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Zechariah">Book of Zechariah</a> in which the Jews' humble king enters Jerusalem this way. The origin of the belief can be found in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah+9%3A9&version=NRSV">Zechariah 9:9</a>: <q>... your king is coming to you; righteous and having salvation is he, humble and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.</q> The 'king' referred to in this verse is interpreted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chazal">Chazal</a> as referring to the Messiah. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament">New Testament</a> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+11%3A1-11&version=NRSV">Mark 11:1-11</a>) it is told that as Jesus approached the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_of_Olives">Mount of Olives</a>, he sent two of his disciples to a nearby village to fetch him a donkey, or exactly an Onager or wild donkey. Upon their return, Jesus then rode the donkey into Jerusalem where he was met by cheering crowds. According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity">Christian</a> religious tradition, this was the fulfillment of the prophecy of Zechariah 9:9.</p><p>People along the way lay cloaks and small branches of trees (known as palm fronds) in front of him and sing part of <a href="https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26b8.htm#25">Psalms 118:25-26</a>.</div>

      <p>Jesus next expels the money changers from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Temple">Second Temple</a>, accusing them of turning it into a den of thieves through their commercial activities. He then prophesies about the coming destruction, including false prophets, wars, earthquakes, celestial disorders, persecution of the faithful, the appearance of an "abomination of desolation," and unendurable tribulations.</p>
      <p> The mysterious "Son of Man," he says, will dispatch angels to gather the faithful from all parts of the earth. Jesus warns that these wonders will occur in the lifetimes of the hearers.</p>

This potent sign increases the tension with authorities, who conspire to kill him. The raising of Lazarus is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracles_of_Jesus">miracle of Jesus</a> recounted only in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_John">Gospel of John</a> (John 11:1–44) in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament">New Testament</a> in which Jesus raises Lazarus of Bethany from the dead four days after his entombment. The event is said to have taken place at Bethany – today the Palestinian town of Al-Eizariya, which translates to <b>"the place of Lazarus"</b>. In John, this is the last of the miracles that Jesus performs before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passion_of_Jesus">passion</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus">crucifixion</a> and his own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection_of_Jesus">resurrection</a>.</p></div>

        <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_of_Bethany"> Mary of Bethany</a> anoints Jesus' feet, foreshadowing his entombment. Jesus then makes his Messianic entry into Jerusalem. Medieval <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Christianity">Western Christianity</a> identified Mary of Bethany with Mary Magdalene and with the sinful woman of <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+7%3A36%E2%80%9350&version=NRSV">Luke 7:36–50.</a> This influenced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Rite">Roman Rite</a> liturgy of the feast of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a>, with a Gospel reading about the sinful woman and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collect">collect</a> referring to Mary of Bethany. Since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysterii_Paschalis">1969 revision</a> of that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liturgy">liturgy</a>, Mary Magdalene's feast day continues to be on 22 July, but Mary of Bethany is celebrated, together with her brother Lazarus, on 29 July, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_(liturgy)">memorial</a> of their sister Martha. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Christianity">Eastern Christianity</a> and some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism">Protestant</a> traditions, Mary of Bethany and Mary Magdalene are considered separate people.

        <p>Jesus comes into conflict with the Jewish elders, such as when they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority_of_Jesus_questioned">question his authority</a> and when he <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woes_of_the_Pharisees">criticizes them and calls them hypocrites</a>.

In Matthew they are mentioned after Jesus' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumphal_entry_into_Jerusalem">triumphal entry into Jerusalem</a>, where he teaches in the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Temple"> Temple</a>, while in Luke they are mentioned after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord%27s_Prayer">Lord's prayer</a> is given and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disciple_(Christianity)">disciples</a> are first sent out over the land.

The woes are all woes of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocrisy"> hypocrisy</a> and illustrate the differences between inner and outer moral states.

     		<li> In Matthew 26:57, Mark 14:53 and Luke 22:54, Jesus is taken to the house of the high priest, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caiaphas">Caiaphas</a>, where he is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mocking_of_Jesus">mocked</a> and beaten that night. Early the next morning, the chief priests and scribes lead Jesus away into their council.</li>
     		<li> John 18:12–14 states that Jesus is first taken to Annas, Caiaphas' father-in-law, and then to the high priest.</li>
     	<dt><b>The Jewish elders</b> take Jesus to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilate%27s_court">Pilate's Court</a> and ask the Roman governor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontius_Pilate">Pontius Pilate</a>, to judge and condemn Jesus for various allegations: subverting the nation, opposing the payment of tribute, claiming to be Christ, a King, and claiming to be the son of God.</dt> 
     	<dd>&bigstar;The use of the word "king" is central to the discussion between Jesus and Pilate. In John 18:36 Jesus states, "My kingdom is not from this world", but he does not unequivocally deny being the King of the Jews. In Luke 23:7–15, Pilate realizes that Jesus is a Galilean, and thus comes under the jurisdiction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herod_Antipas">Herod Antipas</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodian_Tetrarchy">Tetrarch</a> of Galilee and Perea. </dd>
     	<dt> &bigstar;Pilate sends Jesus to Herod to be tried, but Jesus says almost nothing in response to Herod's questions. Herod and his soldiers mock Jesus, put an expensive robe on him to make him look like a king, and return him to Pilate,[290] who then calls together the Jewish elders and announces that he has "not found this man guilty"</dt>
     	<p>&bigstar;Observing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover">Passover</a> custom of the time, Pilate allows one prisoner chosen by the crowd to be released. He gives the people a choice between Jesus and a murderer called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barabbas">Barabbas</a> (ב Bar-abbâ, "son of the father", from the common given name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abba_(given_name)">Abba</a>: 'father'). Persuaded by the elders, the mob chooses to release Barabbas and crucify Jesus. Pilate writes a sign in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek that reads "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews" (abbreviated as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus,_King_of_the_Jews#INRI">INRI</a> in depictions) to be affixed to Jesus' cross, then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellation_of_Christ">scourges Jesus</a> and sends him to be crucified. The soldiers place a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_of_thorns">Crown of Thorns</a> on Jesus' head and ridicule him as the King of the Jews. They beat and taunt him before taking him to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvary">Calvary</a>, also called Golgotha, for crucifixion.</p>

     <h3>Crucifixion and entombment</h3>
     <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Pietro_Perugino_040.jpg/270px-Pietro_Perugino_040.jpg" alt="" height="400">
     <p>&bigstar;Jesus' crucifixion is described in all four canonical gospels. After the trials, Jesus is led to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_Carrying_the_Cross">Calvary carrying his cross</a>; the route traditionally thought to have been taken is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Dolorosa">Via Dolorosa</a>. The three Synoptic Gospels indicate that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_of_Cyrene">Simon of Cyrene</a> assists him, having been compelled by the Romans to do so. In Luke 23:27–28, Jesus tells the women in the multitude of people following him not to weep for him but for themselves and their children. At Calvary, Jesus is offered a sponge soaked in a concoction usually offered as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic">painkiller</a>. According to Matthew and Mark, he refuses it.</p>
     <p>&bigstar;The soldiers then crucify Jesus and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortes_(ancient_Rome)">cast lots</a> for his clothes. Above Jesus' head on the cross is Pilate's inscription, "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews." Soldiers and passersby <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mocking_of_Jesus">mock</a> him about it. Two convicted thieves are crucified along with Jesus. In Matthew and Mark, both thieves mock Jesus. In Luke, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impenitent_thief">one of them</a> rebukes Jesus, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penitent_thief">the other</a> defends him. Jesus tells the latter: "today you will be with me in Paradise." In John, Mary, the mother of Jesus, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disciple_whom_Jesus_loved">beloved disciple</a> were at the crucifixion. Jesus tells the beloved disciple to take care of his mother.</p>
     <p>&bigstar;The Roman soldiers break the two thieves' legs (a procedure designed to hasten death in a crucifixion), but they do not break those of Jesus, as he is already dead (John 19:33). In John 19:34, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longinus">one soldier</a> pierces Jesus' side with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Lance">lance</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Holy_Wounds">blood and water</a> flow out. In the Synoptics, when Jesus dies, the heavy curtain at the Temple is torn. In Matthew 27:51–54, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_darkness">earthquake breaks open tombs</a>. In Matthew and Mark, terrified by the events, a Roman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centurion">centurion</a> states that Jesus was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_of_God_(Christianity)">Son of God.</a></p>
     <p>&bigstar;On the same day, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_of_Arimathea">Joseph of Arimathea</a>, with Pilate's permission and with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicodemus">Nicodemus</a>' help, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_from_the_Cross">removes Jesus' body from the cross</a>, wraps him in a clean cloth, and buries him in his new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb">rock-hewn tomb</a>. In Matthew 27:62–66, on the following day the chief Jewish priests ask Pilate for the tomb to be secured, and with Pilate's permission the priests place seals on the large stone covering the entrance.</p>

     <h3>Resurrection and ascension</h3>

     <p>&bigstar;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a> (alone in the Gospel of John, but accompanied by other women in the Synoptics) goes to Jesus' tomb on Sunday morning and is surprised to find it empty. Despite Jesus' teaching, the disciples had not understood that Jesus would rise again. Jesus then appears to the eleven remaining disciples in Galilee and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Commission">commissions</a> them to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism">baptize all nations</a> in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, "teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you." </p>
     <p>&bigstar;In John, Mary is alone at first, but Peter and the beloved disciple come and see the tomb as well. Jesus then appears to Mary at the tomb. He later appears to the disciples, breathes on them, and gives them the power to forgive and retain sins. In a second visit to disciples, he proves to a doubting disciple ("<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubting_Thomas">Doubting Thomas</a>") that he is flesh and blood. The disciples return to Galilee, where Jesus makes another appearance. He performs a miracle known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miraculous_catch_of_fish#Second_miraculous_catch_of_fish">catch of 153 fish</a> at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a>, after which Jesus encourages Peter to serve his followers.</p>
     <p>&bigstar;Jesus' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entering_heaven_alive">ascension into Heaven</a> is described in Luke 24:50–53, Acts 1:1–11 and mentioned in 1 Timothy 3:16. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_the_Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a>, forty days after the Resurrection, as the disciples look on, "he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight". 1 Peter 3:22 states that Jesus has "gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God".<p>
